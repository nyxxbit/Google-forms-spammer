![Screenshot of the script running](https://i.imgur.com/vrGevgr.png)

A high-performance automation script developed in Python to submit responses to one or multiple Google Forms massively and concurrently. The tool features a rich command-line interface (CLI) built with the `rich` library that displays real-time progress.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Targets:** Send responses to several Google Forms links simultaneously in the same session.
- **Proxy Support:** Utilizes HTTP/HTTPS proxy lists to anonymize and distribute requests, automatically downloading and testing them.
- **Intelligent Navigation:** Handles multi-page forms transparently, simulating user navigation.
- **Interface:** Presents a terminal dashboard with individual progress bars for each target, real-time status, and colored logs.
- **High Performance:** Uses multi-threading to send a large number of submissions in a short period, intelligently distributing threads among active targets.
- **Random Data Generation:** Automatically fills all common question types (text, multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdown lists, grids, etc.) with random data.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Save the script:**
    Save the code in a file with the `.py` extension (e.g., `form_spammer.py`).

2. **Create the `requirements.txt` file:**
    In the same directory, create a file called `requirements.txt` with the following content:
    ```
    requests
    beautifulsoup4
    rich
    pyfiglet
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üíª How to Use

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    python form_spammer.py
    ```
3. The program will interactively request the following information:
    - **Form URLs:** Enter one Google Forms link at a time and press Enter. Leave blank and press Enter to finish adding links.
    - **Use Proxies:** `y` for yes or `n` for no.
    - **Delay:** Time in seconds between submissions (e.g., `0.1`).
    - **Successful Submissions:** Target number of successful submissions *per link*.
    - **Total Threads:** The total number of simultaneous submissions that will be distributed among active links.

The script will start the process, displaying a dashboard with real-time progress.
